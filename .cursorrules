# Shared AI Utils - Agent Rules

You are an AI coding assistant working on the **Shared AI Utils** repository.

## CRITICAL: Read Before ANY Task

Before starting any task, you MUST read and follow: `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the repository root.

This file contains:

- Coding standards (black, type hints)
- Project structure
- Development workflows
- Testing requirements

## Quick Rules

1. **Format**: Use `black` (line-length 100)
2. **Style**: `snake_case` for functions, `PascalCase` for classes
3. **Type Hints**: Required for all public functions
4. **Tests**: All new features require pytest tests
5. **Security**: NEVER log API keys or commit `.env` files

## Key Commands

```bash
black src/           # Format
pytest               # Test
```

## Pre-Commit Hook Requirements (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Before creating new code, ensure you:

1. **Include ALL required imports** - Check existing similar files for import patterns
2. **Add type hints** - All new functions need type annotations
3. **Format docstrings correctly** - One-line: `"""Description."""` (no blank line)
4. **Handle FastAPI Depends()** - Use `# noqa: B008` for `Depends()` in function signatures
5. **Check YAML indentation** - Use 2 spaces consistently
6. **Remove unused imports** - Especially in test files
7. **Run pre-commit hooks** - Execute `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing (if configured)

**Common failures to avoid:**
- Missing imports (NameError or mypy: "Name X is not defined")
- Unused imports
- Wrong YAML indentation
- Missing docstrings
- Long lines

**Always run the pre-commit checklist before finishing:**
```bash
black src/ && yamllint . && pre-commit run --all-files
```

**See `.agent/workflows/pre-commit-checklist.md` for detailed checklist and common fixes.**

## Planning & Roadmap Guidelines

### Time Estimation Rule

**Rule for Future Planning Agents**: When creating plans or roadmaps:

1. **Do NOT include time estimates** (days, weeks, months) unless you have:
   - Actual historical data from similar completed tasks in the same codebase
   - Verified duration data from project management systems
   - User-provided time constraints

2. **Instead, use**:
   - **Complexity indicators**: Low, Medium, High, Very High
   - **Effort indicators**: Small, Medium, Large
   - **Dependencies**: List blocking dependencies
   - **Prerequisites**: What must be done first

3. **If time estimates are requested**:
   - Base them on similar completed tasks in the codebase
   - Clearly state the assumptions and data sources
   - Mark estimates as "rough" or "tentative"
   - Prefer ranges over specific dates

4. **Rationale**: Time estimates are highly variable and depend on:
   - Developer experience and familiarity
   - Unexpected technical challenges
   - External dependencies
   - Scope changes during implementation
   - Context switching and interruptions

This rule should be followed when updating ROADMAP.md or any planning documents.
